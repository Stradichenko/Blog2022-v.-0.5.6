# HUGO for blogging
Works on JAMstack, which is a web architecture or _web stack_ based upon Javascript for programming, APIs for services and Markup Language for content. The term was first coined by Matt Biilmann in 2016.
JAMstack stores all the content into files compiled/prerendered/precomputed during deployment that are later distributed over a Contend Delivery Network (CDN). It also heavily relies on HTML and CSS.

JSON files can act as _pseudo_ API.
All the static content is user-agnostic and fast to produce. For dynamic data, Javascript provides interactivity and personalization. JS can not be pre-compiled. JS can store the user state in the browser.
Regarding APIs only dynamic updates based on user actions in the website (purchases and comments) need dedicated APIs.
With markup language HUGO uses YAML, TOML, and Markdown.


Hugo is a website builder written in Go (Golang). Alternative builders are Gatsby, Jekyll, Nuxt and Next.js. Pelican written in Python and mdBook in Rust.
The creator is Steve Francia and is the fastest feature-rich static site builder.
