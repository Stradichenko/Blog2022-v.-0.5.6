# Notes on storytelling
[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Narrative)

Stories is a way in which we can express identity.

Storytelling is the act of sharing stories. 
Storytelling could be extended far from the current use of story creation for marketing. Storytelling is the _way_ the information is shared.

- Note from the Elephant in the Brain to look for the reason why stories are told. Is not only on the creation of stories but also the reason to share this addictive component.


A **narrative**, **story** or **tale** is any account of a series of related events or experiences.
Along with [argumentation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Argumentation "Argumentation"), [description](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Description "Description"), and [exposition](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Exposition_(narrative) "Exposition (narrative)"), narration, broadly defined, is one of four [rhetorical modes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rhetorical_mode "Rhetorical mode") of discourse.
* ***Rhetorical modes** (also known as **modes of discourse**) describe the variety, ==conventions==, and purposes of the major kinds of [language](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Language "Language")-based [communication](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Communication "Communication"), particularly [writing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Writing) and [speaking](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Speech).
* A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [discourse](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Discourse "Discourse")), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the [plot](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Plot_(narrative) "Plot (narrative)"), which can also mean "story synopsis").
