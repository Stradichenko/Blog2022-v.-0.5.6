# The bioinformatician

The purpose of this serie is to highlight the elements in terms of mindset that I found useful to progress (as a bioinformatician). You may just take it as advices but each has its own reason of being to make life a lot more easy.

The elements are:
- Habits
- Proper writing
- [[Searching_for_information_as_a_bioinformatician]]
- Synergy
- The cost of breathing
- [Asking_for_help](Asking_for_help.md): 
	-  
- Testing
