# Gene Ontology (GO)
Out of respect for the practicality and effort on Wikipedia, let's say that GO is a consortium stablished to **Unify** the _vocabulary_ through easy access and annotation of the gene-product's **functions**.

The ontology covers:
- Cellular component
- Molecular function
- Biological process

We have to take into account that GO is NOT the only existing effort to unify genetic functions. Other databases are...

_Nevertheless, when it comes to unification is my opinion that centralization of the information would be beneficial to the growth of the vocabulary itself. The evolution of the current platform won't come from direct competition but as derivative efforts from the community with the existing and readily available building blocks_.


## Why is gene ontology important?

## How to use the GO?
NGL, the gap for its usage is not as easy as it seems at the beginning. The immediate ways to interact with information are:

- AmiGO: for ontology and annotations.
- GO-CAM: for the linking framework.
- API
