# _Critical Assessments_ (CA) in the fields of Life Sciences
## Definition _What is it?_
According to the 

But is more about a committee that evaluate the effort of different research groups in their approach to solve a problem (in this case associated to Life Sciences).

## _Why is it important?_
Its importance settle in pooling results to better solve a problem. It becomes the community's "gold standard" to a solution. It's granted that there is no one way to solve the problem and that the current solution can always be improved.
This section is more about keeping update the current state of different CA and the importance of results.
