# The Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA)
The reason of being for CAFA is to evaluate the quality on prediction of unknown functions of a protein. 
- A large number of proteins are given and in between the time given for prediction and the assessments there an space for a portion of the proteins' function to be reported through experiments (these become the **benchmark** used in the assessment section). 

Something important to understand is that CAFA relies heavy in [[Gene Ontology]].
