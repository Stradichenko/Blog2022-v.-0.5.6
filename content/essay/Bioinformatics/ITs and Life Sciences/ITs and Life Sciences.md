# ITs and Life Sciences
The purpose of this series is to try to shorten the gap between what is formally thought in college and what is often needed for the suitable use of new technologies.  

If you are cautious while checking the all readily-available tools to work with there's an invisible wall that is behind the _readily-available_. And it is the fact there's a hidden capstone in mathematics and system engineering that is assumed by the creators of these amazing tools made for the usage of the Health and Life Sciences community.
From my short life experience I haven't see Calculus and Python as core subjects in Biology or Medicine (And let's even assume that all Life Science and Health schools around the globe release proficient professionals in the English Language).
If by now you have you felt the disparity in the Syllabus and the needs of the virtual scene this series is meant to fill a bit those voids, through a personal account of tools and skills I needed to acquire to surpass some hindrances in my journey across bioinformatics.

INTRODUCIR WIDGET QUE HABILITE EL ACCESO A CADA UNO DE LOS ITEMS MAS NECESARIOS.

The following list of items are proposed as swiss-knife tools meaning. They are of daily use in the bioinformatic profession.
This set is meant for absolute beginner. I try not to make any step that hasn't been explained before but with the intention of an step 

## [[Git and Github for Bioinformatics]]
## [API for Bioinformatics](API%20for%20Bioinformatics.md)
## [[R for Bioinformatics]]
## [[Python-for-Bionformatics]]
## [[Mathematics for Bioinformatics]]
## [[From Bash to Powershell in bioinformatics]]
## [[SQL and NoSQL for Bioinformatics]]
## [[R for Bioinformatics]]
