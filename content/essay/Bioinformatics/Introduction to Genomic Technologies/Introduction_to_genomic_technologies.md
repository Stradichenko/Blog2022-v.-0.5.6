# Introduction to Genomic Technologies

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
The ingredients are: DNA, primers, DNA polymerase, A, C, G, T.

Starting with primers, is a sequence of generally 15-20

The **DNA polymerase**

Through the anneal 

## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
### landmarks
- 1997-1990: Sanger DNA sequencing,
- ~1990-: DNA microarrays
- ~2007-: 2nd. generation DNA sequencing (NGS): 
- ~2010-: 3rd. generation & single molecule sequencing

## NGS applications
- Exome sequencing
- RNA-seq: is a way to studying expression by capturing the RNA. After transcription a AAAAA string is attached at the end (RNA cap).
- ChIP-seq:
- Bisulphate sequencing or methelsync: a tool to determine methylation through bisulphate conversion which converts Cs to Us and then they are sequenced.

### Memory and Data Structures
1 binary digit = 1bit = 0 or 1
1 byte = 8 bits = 0000 0000

### Efficiency
### Software engineering
