# FOSS
The second part is concerned with software. This is meant to be automated. To create the working environment as fast as possible with an ISO and a script attached to a USB.

## Tech sandwich
Linux Distribution gets the code for all the applications and build them into packages, is a shipment.

## Desktop environment
## Distribution (Distro) 
## Window Manager 
## Tile Manager
## X Window System


### Linux kernel
First released in 1991.
Today this kernel is extremely common in technology.

### GNU tools
Started in 1980s by Richard Stallman and is an alternative to UNIX.

### Boot loader
The first software that run. It does it through the MBR (or GPT) partition on the hard drive. It boots the kernel. The most common boot loader is GRUB.

### Shell
In this case, Bash/Powershell is an ideal shell. But is not only about the shell but things that can be added to improve the shell experience:

[Improving-the-shell-experience](Improving-the-shell-experience.md)

[Improving-the-shell-experience](Improving-the-shell-experience/)

This last link DOES generate a link in Obsidian but not a working site in Netlify
[Improving-the-shell-experience](blog/content/hobby/FOSS-PC/Improving-the-shell-experience.md)

This is a new test on the way Obisdian creates links. Settings: same folder /relative path:

[[../../../../../Improving-the-shell-experience]]


[[../../../../../Improving-the-shell-experience]]


[[Improving-the-shell-experience]]

This is a new note to test the way Obsidian NOW links new elements
