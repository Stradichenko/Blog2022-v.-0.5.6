# FOSS & FOSH



This series focus mainly on my journey to the generation of a FOSS and FOSH system.
The reasons to go through out this endeavour is mostly to understand the behind processes surrounding the day-to-day technology. Technology not only facilitate information but the access itself to understanding our daily appliances.
Also regarding a culture crowdsourcing-based software engineering (CBSE), is to put value in technology developed by the crowd and experts.

What Linux distributions do is that they get the source code for all those applications and build them, converting them into packages that can be installed on users computers and put them in a repository containing all those package.
