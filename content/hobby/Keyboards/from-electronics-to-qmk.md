# From Electronics to QMK
In this post I want to make the a zero-to-hero explanation on how keyboard works from the fundamentals to the actual design of one's own, one-in-a-million, keyboard. The creation of this article was due the gap from the engineers to the average enjoyer in the mechanical keyboard community.

## Objectives
To understand how keyboards work in general and close the distance in knowledge. Bring down to earth some electronic and system engineer concepts and offer existing tools for the fabrication of a personal keyboard.

## Electronic Fundamentals
### he MCU
### The PCB
