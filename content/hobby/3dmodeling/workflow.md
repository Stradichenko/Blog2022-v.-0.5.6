# Blender workflow
Out of the box some addons ease the use of Blender; Some of them are paid:
- Add Curve: Extra Objects
- Add Mesh: Extra Objects
- Mesh: LoopTools
- Interface 3D Viewport Pie Menus

I set some default settings:
Keyamp > Tab for Pie Menu
System > Memory & Limits > Undo Steps: 256
Additionally as a plus I use a color scheme to make it more appealling.
